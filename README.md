#Pixelize With Images
Replaces each pixel of an image with the closest sample from an image database.

Change every path to files in the "constants.py" file. By default the database is in folder "initDb", and the image to pixelize with images is called "image.png" and saved after process as "final_image.png"
Careful, as the size of the final image can grow quite big, sometimes some gigas.
